# Win10SpotlightWalpaper
A batch file that pulls all the Win10 spotlight images from your system files automatically, and adds the jpg file extension. 

This batch file is meant to be customized to your own needs but can be used as is. 
In order for you to use this batch file as is you will need to 

 - 1. Create the following two directories or run the installer. 
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Spotlight"
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Pictures\Spotlight"

 - 2. Run spotlight.bat
    This will copy the files from your system folder to the "documents\spotlight" folder. Then both directories that were created will open. You will need to simply pick out the spotlight images and move them to the "pictures\spotlight" directory. 
    
Note: you could have all of the images go into that folder but some images are icons for Windows 10 apps and not spotlight images.
